        Dear Velate Sullivan:
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in applying for the Campus File Storage Project internship. I've read through the list of duties that I would be responsible for and I beleive that I am an ideal canidate for the position.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently studying for a BS in Computer Science and I posses a lot of knowledge on many areas in computing. I like to think that I know a little bit about everything. When I do not know a subject, I am able to self-teach and understand in a short period of time. For instance, I have experience in many programming languages and with the exception of C, C#, and Java, I have learned all of them on my own. I am also not afraid to ask questions; pride does not get in the way of completing a task. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the qualifications you list is customer service experience. While I have not had a typical customer service job, my current employment at a caterer affords many opportunities to interact with customers. I am often asked for help with things that are outside of the normal scope of my job, but I am willing to go the extra mile to make a customer happy. It truly is a pleasure for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Lengthen this a bit?)
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to wholeheartedly thank you for taking the time to read my application. I look forward to your response   regarding an interview.
      </p>
      <p>Yours truly,</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Micah Fitzgerald</p>
